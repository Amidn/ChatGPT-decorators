# How to Use (Quick Start)

1) Load the YAML into the chat  
   - Upload **ChatGPTdecorators.yml** to the conversation.  
   - Send:  
     ```
     Read ChatGPTdecorators.yml as instructions
     ```  
   - ChatGPT is flexible about parsing; this line is usually enough to activate the decorators.

2) Verify itâ€™s loaded  
   - Send:
     ```
     @@Help
     ```
   - You should see a header with author/version and a list of decorators.

3) Use decorators  
   - Examples:
     ```
     @@chat @@Tone(technical) @@StepByStep
     Explain neutrino oscillations for a graduate audience.
     ```
     ```
     @@message @@OutputFormat(json)
     Summarize the following text in one JSON object with keys: tl;dr, key_points.
     ```

4) In isolated/non-member projects (with a Files section + Instructions box)  
   - Upload **ChatGPTdecorators.yml** under Files.  
   - In the **Instructions** box add:  
     ```
     Read ChatGPTdecorators.yml as instructions
     ```  
   - Then test with `@@Help`.
